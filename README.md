## Commodity Trading Seminar

The commodity trading seminar was the brand new seminar from the Erasmus University Rotterdam during the 2017-2018 academic year. During the seminar, students learned about how the commodities, mainly agricultural products, were trading.

The scope was wide, and the curriculum covered not only for studying research papers but also for analysing actual commodity prices. My group chose the coffee price, especially the Robusta coffee.

My role was managing data for forecasting the prices of Robusta with other factors.

Most of the forecastings were done using STATA because of the statistical advantages of STATA. I used python for preprocessing and cleaning our data set.

Following codes are sample codes what I had done during the seminar.

#### 1. Preprocessing and cleaning for forecasting

The enormous number of factors are influencing to the Robusta coffee price. Group members of mine determined the factors for forecasting the Robusta price.

The Brent crude price, coffee inventories in certified warehouses, Arabica coffee price in Brazil, and the weighted currency rates are used for forecasting.

#### 2. Monte Carlo Simulation

100 times of the Monte Carlo simulation was done by python code. 
Robusta coffee spot price and other variables such as Arabica coffee price in Brazil, Brent crude oil, Inventories in certified storage, Absolute value of weather consition, and the forex rates of Brazil were used for Monte Carlo.
